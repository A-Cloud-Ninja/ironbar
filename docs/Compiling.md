You can compile Ironbar from source using `cargo`. 
Just clone the repo and build:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jakestanger/ironbar.git
cd ironbar
cargo build --release
# change path to wherever you want to install
install target/release/ironbar ~/.local/bin/ironbar
```

## Features

By default, all features are enabled for convenience. This can result in a significant compile time.
If you know you are not going to need all the features, you can compile with only the features you need.

As of `v0.10.0`, compiling with no features is about 33% faster. 
On a 3800X, it takes about 60 seconds for no features and 90 seconds for all. 
This difference is expected to increase as the bar develops. 

Features containing a `+` can be stacked, for example `config+json` and `config+yaml` could both be enabled.

To build using only specific features, disable default features and pass a comma separated list to `cargo build`:

```shell
cargo build --release --no-default-features \
  --features http,config+json,clock
```

> âš  Make sure you enable at least one `config` feature otherwise you will not be able to start the bar!
